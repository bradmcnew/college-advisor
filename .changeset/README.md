# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to use changesets

When you make changes to the packages in this monorepo, you should add a changeset describing the changes:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the type of change (patch, minor, major)
3. Write a summary of the changes

Then commit the generated changeset file along with your changes.

## Releasing

To create releases, run:

```bash
pnpm version-packages  # Creates version bump PRs
pnpm release          # Publishes to npm
```

Note: The web app (`@discuno/web`) is ignored from changesets as it's deployed, not published to npm.
